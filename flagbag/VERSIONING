Versioning of file-releases related to the flagbag project
==========================================================

After alot of thinking, I, the admin of the project thought
that the following versioning-method is most suitable for
our current needs:

MAJOR.MINOR.FIX

For example: 0.5.5
 What this really means is:

 o Not yet a fully completed major-release).
 
 o Lots of minor fixes has been done (layouting, comments, re-structure, etc)

 o Lots of bug-fixes and re-design to avoid problems in the future.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that the FIX-versions don't have to be fully
           compatible with each other under the same MINOR-version.
           Although any MINOR-version should have more or less all
           structures in common. This means that 0.5.1 and 0.5.5 is
           don't need to have the same layouting but they do need to
           have the same publishing-system in order to fit in for the
           user. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!

The CVS-server versioning should only be used on single files in case of 
backup needs.
